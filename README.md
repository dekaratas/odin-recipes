# odin-recipes

My goal was to write a simple home page listing links to various recipes that include an image, a list for ingredients and and a list of cooking steps.

In this small project I was able to reflect on the skills I have acquired
throughout the HTML-Basics section of The Odin Project.


These include:
- Working with Git
- Cloning repositories from GitHub
- Staging and committing via Git
- Understanding what makes a sensible commit message
- Utilizing ordered and unordered lists in HTML
- Using various basic HTML tags such as <a>, <img> and <h2>
- Writing basic boilerplate code for an HTML file
- Getting a better understanding for a website's file structure
